============

This repository uses Propel (a PHP ORM) which should be installed (including it's dependencies) via Composer.
A corresponding `composer.json` file already exists and defines the needed dependencies.

To automatically download Propel with all dependencies the command `php composer.phar install` should be used.
If Composer is not installed already, it can be obtained via `curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php`.
